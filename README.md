# PPCL-Script-Generation
This repo has the code and the template files required for the automation for script generation for PPCL codes.


The only step needed other than installing all the depenencies is that the HTML files need to be added in a folder inside the folder where all the code and templates are saved. The folder name should be 'templates'.
